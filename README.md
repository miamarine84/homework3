So index.html was my attempt at using the prompt and alert choices and it worked pretty well.

For a more challengeable thing i chose to make it a bit more user interactive hence index1.html and script1.js

I believe I did what was necessary just please leave a comment if there is a simpler way of doing this?

As well as my main issue was I could not get it to say.....the user chooses only 8 characters and all choices (ie uppercase, lowercase, special character, and number). How would i go about it to make sure that he gets all those in his passowrd.

Please any and all feedback would be greatly appreciated. Thanks...
